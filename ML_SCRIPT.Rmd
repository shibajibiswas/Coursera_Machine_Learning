#Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).


#Data

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv


The data for this project come from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

```{r}
setwd("F:/JHU_DataScience/Coursera_ML")


```
##Preliminary Work

##Reproduceability

An overall pseudo-random number generator seed was set at 1234 for all code. In order to reproduce the results below, the same seed should be used.
Different packages were downloaded and installed, such as caret and randomForest. These should also be installed in order to reproduce the results below (please see code below for ways and syntax to do so).

##How the model was built

Our outcome variable is classe, a factor variable with 5 levels. For this data set, "participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in 5 different fashions:

- exactly according to the specification (Class A)
- throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
- lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
- lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
- throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes." [1]
Prediction evaluations will be based on maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the out-of-sample error. All other available variables after cleaning will be used for prediction.
Two models will be tested using decision tree and random forest algorithms. The model with the highest accuracy will be chosen as our final model.

##Cross-validation

Cross-validation will be performed by subsampling our training data set randomly without replacement into 2 subsamples: subTraining data (75% of the original Training data set) and subTesting data (25%). Our models will be fitted on the subTraining data set, and tested on the subTesting data. Once the most accurate model is choosen, it will be tested on the original Testing data set.

##Code and Results
##Packages, Libraries, Seed

##Installing packages, loading libraries, and setting the seed for reproduceability:

```{r}
#install.packages("caret")
#install.packages("randomForest")
#install.packages("rpart")
#install.packages("e1071")
library(caret)
library(randomForest) #Random forest for classification and regression
library(rpart) # Regressive Partitioning and Regression trees
library(rpart.plot) # Decision Tree plot
library(e1071)
# setting the overall seed for reproduceability
set.seed(1234)
```
##Loading data sets and preliminary cleaning

First we want to load the data sets into R and make sure that missing values are coded correctly.
Irrelevant variables will be deleted.
Results will be hidden from the report for clarity and space considerations.

```{r}
# After saving both data sets into my working directory
# Some missing values are coded as string "#DIV/0!" or "" or "NA" - these will be changed to NA.
# We notice that both data sets contain columns with all missing values - these will be deleted.  

# Loading the training data set into my R session replacing all missing with "NA"
trainingset <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""))

# Loading the testing data set 
testingset <- read.csv('pml-testing.csv', na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""))

# Check dimensions for number of variables and number of observations
dim(trainingset)
dim(testingset)

# Delete columns with all missing values
trainingset<-trainingset[,colSums(is.na(trainingset)) == 0]
testingset <-testingset[,colSums(is.na(testingset)) == 0]

# Some variables are irrelevant to our current project: user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_,2 cvtd_timestamp, new_window, and  num_window (columns 1 to 7). We can delete these variables.
trainingset   <-trainingset[,-c(1:7)]
testingset <-testingset[,-c(1:7)]

# and have a look at our new datasets:
dim(trainingset)
dim(testingset)
head(trainingset)
head(testingset)




```
Partitioning the training data set to allow cross-validation

The training data set contains 53 variables and 19622 obs.
The testing data set contains 53 variables and 20 obs.
In order to perform cross-validation, the training data set is partionned into 2 sets: subTraining (75%) and subTest (25%).
This will be performed using random subsampling without replacement.

```{r}
subsamples <- createDataPartition(y=trainingset$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
subTraining <- trainingset[subsamples, ] 
subTesting <- trainingset[-subsamples, ]
dim(subTraining)
dim(subTesting)
head(subTraining)
head(subTesting)


```
##A look at the Data

The variable "classe" contains 5 levels: A, B, C, D and E. A plot of the outcome variable will allow us to see the frequency of each levels in the subTraining data set and compare one another.

```{r}
plot(subTraining$classe, col="blue", main="Bar Plot of levels of the variable classe within the subTraining data set", xlab="classe levels", ylab="Frequency")
```

From the graph above, we can see that each level frequency is within the same order of magnitude of each other. Level A is the most frequent with more than 4000 occurrences while level D is the least frequent with about 2500 occurrences.

##First prediction model: Using Decision Tree

```{r}
model1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=subTraining, method="class")

# Predicting:
prediction1 <- predict(model1, subTesting, type = "class")

# Plot of the Decision Tree
rpart.plot(model1, main="Classification Tree", extra=102, under=TRUE, faclen=0)

```

# Test results on our subTesting data set:
```{r}
confusionMatrix(prediction1, subTesting$classe)
```
#Second prediction model: Using Random Forest
```{r}
model2 <- randomForest(classe ~. , data=subTraining, method="class")

# Predicting:
prediction2 <- predict(model2, subTesting, type = "class")

# Test results on subTesting data set:
confusionMatrix(prediction2, subTesting$classe)

```
##Decision

As expected, Random Forest algorithm performed better than Decision Trees.
Accuracy for Random Forest model was 0.995 (95% CI: (0.993, 0.997)) compared to 0.739 (95% CI: (0.727, 0.752)) for Decision Tree model. The random Forest model is choosen. The accuracy of the model is 0.995. The expected out-of-sample error is estimated at 0.005, or 0.5%. The expected out-of-sample error is calculated as 1 - accuracy for predictions made against the cross-validation set. Our Test data set comprises 20 cases. With an accuracy above 99% on our cross-validation data, we can expect that very few, or none, of the test samples will be missclassified.

## Submission

```{r}
# predict outcome levels on the original Testing data set using Random Forest algorithm
